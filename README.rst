 mic - Mic Image Creator
========================

Overview
--------
MIC means Image Creator and it's used to create images for Tizen. The tool offers three major functions:

- image creation
- image conversion
- chrooting into an image

The tool is derived mainly from MIC2, which is used to create MeeGo images. With great improvements on many features, it has become clear, friendly, and flexible. It provides a python plugin mechanism for developers, to expand image type or image options, and even to hook.

With the MIC tool, users can create different types of images for different verticals, including live CD images, live USB images, raw images for KVM, loop images for IVI platforms, and fs images for chrooting. Also, users can work in a chroot environment, based on an existing live image using MIC's enhanced chrooting. Besides, MIC enables transforming an image to another image format, a very useful function for those sensitive to image format.
